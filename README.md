A2 Geometric Kandinsky Insprired Artworks: How to operate the artworks on Processing

My A2 project prototype is called Geometric Kandinsky inspired artworks. The aim of this project was to learn and understand code and how to apply the skills learnt in practice. The goal of the project was to create two digital visual artworks using code. The functioning of the artworks is dependent on the coding environment Processing. The artworks have been coded with JavaScript coding language.

HOW TO OPERATE THE ARTWORKS ON PROCESSING
The Processing software application must be downloaded onto the user's computer in order to launch the software. 

To set Processing to JavaScript coding language, press the top right button and pick 'Java'.

As the artworks are still, visual artworks, to run the function of each artwork, press the play button on the top left of the Processing application for each artwork on Processing.

To stop and close the artwork, press the button on the right of the play button which has the stop symbol. 

Note: The two artworks run separately so the Processing application will only have the coding for one artwork on one canvas and the second artwork on the second artwork. The coding has been uploaded as separate files labelled 'A2_Artwork_1' and 'A2_Artwork_2'.
